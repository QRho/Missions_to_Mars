# Web_Scraping_Challenge
#### Mission to Mars!
##### Boy was this fun. 

##### Notes: I've included the script that converts the scrape and the flask python script as well. 
For safe keeping I wanted to keep all parts together. 

1.) You will notice that I did not use a CSS sheet, I did all in line styling as a time consideration. 

2.) Some of the code from the notebook used to scrape has been tweaked a little to be used in the scrape application file MongoFlaskScrappy.py, 
It would have helped to have known in advance that every thing found in a scrape needs its own indivdual variable. 

3.)Really happy with the application this is a great way to summarize data and keep an up to date DB of the information. 

4.) I've included a PNG called Timestamp to prove that the most recent news from the site listed was May 21, 2020 even though the site was scraped as recently as Sat May 23rd.
